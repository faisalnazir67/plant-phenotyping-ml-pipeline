## üå± Project Overview

An advanced computer vision pipeline for automated plant phenotyping that combines state-of-the-art deep learning models to analyze plant health, segment individual leaves, and extract comprehensive morphological and physiological traits. This system enables precise, non-invasive assessment of plant characteristics for agricultural research and practical farming applications.

**Supervisor:** Dr. Murtaza Taj  
**Team:** Mohammad Salman, Muhammad Faisal Nazir

## üéØ Key Features

- **Automated Plant Detection**: Uses GroundingDINO for precise plant identification
- **Advanced Leaf Segmentation**: FastSAM and SAM integration for individual leaf isolation
- **Comprehensive Trait Analysis**: 15+ morphological and physiological measurements
- **Health Assessment**: Real-time plant health scoring and stress detection
- **Interactive Demo**: Streamlit web interface for easy testing
- **Professional Output**: JSON reports with detailed analysis results

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Core Pipeline Components

1. **Stage 1: Plant Detection**
   - GroundingDINO with SwinT backbone
   - Text-prompted plant detection ("green plant only without soil")
   - Precise bounding box generation

2. **Stage 2: Background Removal**
   - FastSAM-based segmentation
   - Intelligent background elimination
   - Clean plant isolation

3. **Stage 3: Leaf Segmentation & Analysis**
   - Individual leaf extraction
   - Advanced filtering algorithms (area-based, IoU-based)
   - Comprehensive trait measurement

### Measured Traits

#### Morphological Analysis
- **Leaf Area**: Total surface area for photosynthetic capacity assessment
- **Shape Features**: Circularity, symmetry, and geometric properties
- **Size Metrics**: Length, width, and aspect ratios

#### Color & Health Analysis
- **Green Intensity**: Chlorophyll content estimation
- **DGCI (Dark Green Color Index)**: Plant health indicator
- **Color Uniformity**: Disease and stress detection
- **Vegetation Indices**: Multiple health scoring methods

#### Advanced Features
- **Texture Analysis**: Surface characteristics and patterns
- **Vigor Index**: Combined health assessment score
- **Stress Indicators**: Early warning system for plant problems
